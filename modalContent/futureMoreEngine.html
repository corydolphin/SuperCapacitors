              <h3>More applications of supercapacitors</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">

            <p>Supercapacitors have countless applications in dozens of fields.  Here are some of the more interesting and important ones. </p>

			<p><h4>Start-stop car systems.</h4> Full-gasoline cars that stop the engine while idling. supercapacitors keep the radio and electronics alive without the engine.  It also restarts the car.</p>

			<p><h4>Cell phone batteries.</h4> Even if they only last a few hours, supercapacitors charge quickly.  Also, since supercapacitors can go through many more charge sequences and endure greater temeratures, cell phone batteries will keep working much longer.</p>

			<p><h4>High-end audio.</h4> Supercapacitorss could help audio systems provide a boost for high-current sections, like a big bass boost, which might allow  a 1-watt speaker to provide the power for a 1 kilowatt burst.</p>

			<p><h4>The grid.</h4> Supercapacitors can provide for surges in energy demand, allowing energy to be generated more efficiently.  Also it could store energy from renewable but unreliable energy sources such as wind or solar energy. </p>

			<p><h4>Industry. </h4> Supercapacitors could make cordless tools much more common since they would now be able to provide the power to cut or drill through hard materials without permanently damaging their power supplies.  Also, instead of waiting for new batteries to charge to continue work, the short charge time would allow work to continue with only a few minute interuption.  Also supercapacitors could supply energy  in industrial machines, like cranes, where it could provide the power to lift heavy things. </p>

			<p><h4>Electronics.</h4> Supercapacitors could provide cameras a boost for zooming or for flashes. </p>

			<p><h4>Automotive.</h4>  AC, power steering, locks, windows. Wherever you have high current for small amounts of time, well-placed supercaps might be cheaper than the high-diameter copper wire currently used.</p>

			<p>Of course, these are only applications we can come up with now - the actual possibilities are much wider. </p>
