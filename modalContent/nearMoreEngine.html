	            <p>Supercapacitor-battery hybrids combine the two energy storage systems into a single unit.  These have a layer of lithium-ion material coated on top of the carbon, which can store chemical energy; these layers are wound like traditional capacitors into a cylinder. </p>

				<p> They last longer than batteries because the supercapacitors handle high-draw current, and charge faster because of the nature of how capacitors charge.  The capacitor helps the battery avoid overheating, which makes the battery less efficient. They have higher energy-density than modern supercaps alone - giving them the best of both worlds. </p>


				<p> One company, Ioxus, is already marketing supercapacitors for use in power tools. It only lasts 1/15 as long as a traditional battery, but it can be recharged in a minute - meaning, so long as you have a charger nearby, it's always charged.  They can be recharged 20,000 times and survive a wide variety of temperatures.To top it off, they offer 90-95% effficiencies, which beat lead-acid batteries that have 70% efficiency.  An Ioxus supercapacitor is shown here. </p>
