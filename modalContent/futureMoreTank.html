            <p>Supercapacitors are so great because they have a very high surface area, and a team at MIT has figured out how to even further increase the surface area: carbon nanotubes.  These nanotubes cling to the surface of the capacitor, making a thick mat of surface for charge to build on.  These might increase capacitance by hundreds!  Professor <b>Joel Schindall</b> believes that these could get the energy density of a supercapacitor improved to be about half of that of a lithium-ion cell - making them comparable.  He estimates approximately 5 years until commercialization. </p>
