	              <h3>How supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and gasoline compare</h3>
				<br></br>
				<p>Supercapacitors, gasoline, and lithium-ion batteries use remarkably different energy storage mechanisms. Let's see how they stack up.</p>

	              <table class="table">
					<tr>
						<td><b>Energy storage device</b></td>
						<td><b>Specific energy (MJ/kg)</b></td>
						<td><b>Energy density (MJ/liter)</b></td>
						<td><b>Power density (W/kg)</b></td>
						<td><b>Environmental considerations</b></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Lithium-ion batteries</b></td>
						<td>0.72</td>
						<td>0.9-2.23</td>
						<td>250-340</td>
						<td>Lithium is non-renewable and hard to recycle.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Gasoline</b></td>
						<td>47.2</td>
						<td>34</td>
						<td>Thermodynamically limitied</td>
						<td>Gasoline contributes to increasing atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub> and is increasingly limited supply.</td>

					<tr>
						<td><b>Supercapacitors</b></td>
						<td>0.1</td>
						<td>0.1</td>
						<td>2500-25000</td>
						<td>Several, but not all, supercapacitors use lithium and other elements that are harmful.</td>

						<td>Current methods of mass production use copious amounts of strong acids.</td>

				<p>Some of this data is very surprising.  Gasoline is awesome at energy storage - it stores <i>fifty times</i> more energy per kilogram than lithium-ion batteries, let alone supercapacitors. Power density is also interesting.  It doesn't really make sense to talk about gasoline's power density because different engines release gasoline's energy at different rates, but a supercapacitor can have up to a hundred times higher power density than a battery.  This means that they can dump energy or take in energy that much faster.  That's extremely useful for many applications - keep reading to learn more.</p>
