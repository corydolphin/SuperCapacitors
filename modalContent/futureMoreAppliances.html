	<h2>Household applications of supercapacitors</h2>

	<p>Supercapacitors will be particularly useful in the house because they are able to provide short bursts of energy and recharge quickly.  This will make the experience of many chores different.  Vaccuum cleaners, water heaters, blenders - since these electronic appliances typically are not in operation for very long, they can use the limited energy in a supercapacitor as their power source.  The draw? No more cords and no fear of surges.  These simply recharge in a few seconds from an outlet, or even slowly recharge using wireless energy transfer technologies like induction.  These appliances can also be more powerful when powered by supercapacitors - no longer do their owners have to fear a power surge blowing a fuse.  And less power surges means less strain on the grid, which lets the grid operate at full capacity (as opposed to the 90% it operates at now).</p>

	<p>Some applications might even seem too good to be true. Some companies today have started selling battery-powered lawnmowers, which promise less noise and less upkeep than traditional gas-powered mowers.  A Ryobi model, powered by a 48-Volt battery, is shown to the right.  However, these have all the problems associated with batteries - long charge times, low energy density compared to gasoline, and short life spans.  Future lawnmowers might be powered by supercapacitors, which would (at least) last a lot longer and charge quickly. </p>
