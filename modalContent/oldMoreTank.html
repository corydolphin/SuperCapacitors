	            <p>Gasoline has a high energy density that comes from unstable chemical bonds.  Its energy is released via an exothermic reaction with oxygen from the atmosphere. When you fill your car up with gas it really contains less than a quarter of the reactants by mass - the rest comes from the air.  These components react to form water, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide - and a lot of heat.  </p>
				
				<p>Gasoline itself is derived by performing a process called hydrogenation on crude oil.  TCrude oil is heated while hydrogen is bubbled through the solution to form more regular and higher energy hydrocarbons.  </p>

			<p>In 2010, 474 million barrels of gasoline were consumed in the United States. 474 million barrels is 55.6 million cubic meters, which is 44 million tons, which is 1.94 exaJoules of energy.  A Joule is approximately how much energy lifting an apple a yard is, and an exaJoule is a billion billion. That's a lot. </p>

			<p> This amount of gasoline cost about 58 billion dollars (at 2012 prices) and produced 136 million tons of CO2 (assuming complete combustion).  </p>
