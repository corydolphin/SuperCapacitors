              <p>Hybrid cars, like the Audi A8 hybrid here, combine two motors into their drivetrains: an electric motor and a gasoline engine.  Like most cars, the engine is powered by gasoline, but the electric motor is powered by lithium-ion batteries.  Those batteries charge when the car is braking; rather than squeezing brake pads to slow the car down, a generator turns, turning the car's kinetic energy into an electrical current thatcharges the batteries.  Those batteries are then used to help the gasoline engine with acceleration and regular driving.  Though a hybrid drivetrain helps with fuel efficiency, it's pretty complicated - it has a lot of extra weight from having two systems.  They're a great step forward, but they are still powered by gasoline and are definitely imperfect.</p>
