              <p>Hybrid cars combine two motors into their drivetrains: an electric motor and a gasoline engine.  Like most cars, the engine is powered by gasoline, but the electric motor is powered by lithium-ion batteries.  Those batteries charge when the car is braking; rather than squeezing brake pads to slow the car down, a generator turns, turning the car's kinetic energy into an electrical current that charges the batteries.  Those batteries are then used to help the gasoline engine with acceleration and regular driving.  Though a hybrid drivetrain helps with fuel efficiency, it's pretty complicated - it has a lot of extra weight from having two systems.  They're a great step forward, but they are still powered by gasoline and are definitely imperfect.</p>
              <p>The most famous hybrids are the lightweight, super-efficient ones like the Toyota Prius and the Honda Civic.  However, some luxury automakers, like Lexus, Audi and Cadillac, have also started making hybrid versions of their popular cars, like the Audi A8 to the right.  These show that being green is more than being cheap and utilitarian.</p>
