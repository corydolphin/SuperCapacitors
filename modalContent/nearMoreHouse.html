	             <p> Supercapacitors store energy in an electric field.  A voltage source, like a battery, pushes electrons from one plate to another, which leads to a charge mismatch - electrons on one side, protons on the other.   That difference makes an electric field between the two plates.  The electric field times the distance between the plates is the voltage of the capacitor.  The energy is given by the following equation: </p>

				<p>Which is why supercapacitors are so important - their high capacitance means they can store a lot of energy.  They've got a high capacitance because they have a really high surface area because of the activated carbon.  That high surface means a high capacitance, which means a high energy.  According to (?), surface area is "10,000 to 100,000 times greater than the linear surface area of the naked metal." </p>

				<p> There's a big drawback here, though: Voltage.  Activated carbon breaks down at high voltage, and so they can only handle a voltage of around 2 Volts.  Since voltage is squared to find total energy, that's really unfortunate - a 100 Farad, 1 Volt supercapacitor holds the same amount of energy as a 1 Farad, 10 Volt regular capacitor.  Even though the supercapacitor has a hundred times higher capacitance, the fact that voltage is squared means that the regular capacitor's slightly better voltage matters a whole lot. </p>

				<p> Another drawback is weight-related.  The whole mass of a lithium-ion battery stores energy, but in a capacitor, it's only the surface that can hold charge.  Only a fraction of the mass of the supercapacitor is actually involved in direct energy storage. </p>
