	            <p> Supercapacitors store energy in an electric field.  A voltage source, like a battery, pushes electrons from one plate to another, which leads to a charge mismatch - electrons on one side, protons on the other. That difference makes an electric field between the two plates.  The voltage across a capacitor is the energy gained per unit charge when a charge is moved all the way through that field.  It's almost like height in a gravitational field; height gives a bit of mass potential energy, and the more mass you have, the more energy you have.  Mathematically, it's V=Ed.  The total energy in a capacitor is given by the following equation: </p>

				<p>That's why graphene supercapacitors are so important - their high capacitance means they can store a lot of energy.  They've got a high capacitance because they have a really high surface area thanks to the holes and pockets in the graphene.  That high surface means a high capacitance, which means a high energy.  That surface area can be 100,000 times more than a simple flat piece of metal would have.  In theory, graphene supercapacitors could store 100,000 times more energy than standard capacitors by this increase in surface area.  </p>

				<p> But they don't.  The best supercapacitors have similar, if slightly higher, energy density. The culprit? Voltage.  Activated carbon breaks down at high voltage, and so they can only handle a voltage of around 2-5 Volts, maximum.  Since voltage is squared to find total energy, that's really unfortunate - a 100 Farad, 1 Volt supercapacitor holds the same amount of energy as a 1 Farad, 10 Volt regular capacitor.  In short, voltage matters a lot more than capacitance. </p>

				<p> Another drawback to capacitors is weight-related.  Though they tend have lots of lightweight nonmetals in them, the whole mass of a lithium-ion battery stores energy, but in a capacitor, it's only the surface that can hold charge.  Only a fraction of the mass of the supercapacitor is actually involved in direct energy storage. </p>
