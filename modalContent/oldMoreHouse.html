	            <p>The grid is what we call the energy distribution system that moves electricity from the power plant to other buildings.   Typically, the power plant uses an engine to spin a turbine.  That spinning creates an alternating electrical current, which can be then converted to extremely high voltage- around 100,000 Volts. That high voltage travels happily along power lines until it reaches a neighborhood transformer, which pulls the voltage back down to the friendly 120- and 240- Volts we get from our plugs. That method lets power plants reach a wide distance, since high voltage can transmit a lot of energy. </p>

				<p> Most of the power in the United States comes from coal and natural gas.  These non-renewable resources are cheap and plentiful, but they produce carbon dioxide, are contributors of pollution, and will not last forever.  </p>

				<p> About a third of the nation's energy comes from alternative sources - nuclear, hydroelectric, and things like wind and solar.  Those have their own issues, but advances in technology could make them more viable. </p>
