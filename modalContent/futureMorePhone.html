			<p>Flexible supercapacitors open up the possibility for really interesting devices.  Flexible OLED screens and circuits could mean that an entire device is flexible.  This world is hard to imagine: electronics could be seamlessly integrated into clothing, or wrap around your wrist. This is possible with supercapacitors as the power source.  These supercapacitors are also extremely thin, which means that they can be integrated into existing technology more seamlessly than other power sources and current capacitors.</p>
