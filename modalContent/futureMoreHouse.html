            <p>Currently, several experimental graphene electrode manufacturing processes are under development. None are yet being used for mass-production of graphene, however.</p>
            <p>An interesting note about graphene supercapacitors is that they can be manufactured without industrial-grade equipment.  It's even possible to make these in your backyard.  Click<a href="http://wcdolphin.github.com/SuperCapacitors/instructable.html">here</a> to explore how a team of college kids attempted to make a graphene supercapacitor using materials found in a small materials science lab and around the dorms.  </p>
            <p>The coolest part of the process is using a DVD burner to activate the carbon.  This process is shown below, and proves just how doable it is. </p>
