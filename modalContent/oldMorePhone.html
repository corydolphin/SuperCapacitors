	              <p>Capacitors are electrical components that are important because electrons can get pushed into them. Voltage sources, such as batteries, push electrons around, and in a closed circuit (basically anything that is flipped on), that pushing makes an electrical current that can light up LEDs, move a motor, and so on. Current is defined as flow of electrons.</p>

	              <p>If the circuit is open (that is, broken somehwere so it's not a complete loop) the electrons might get pushed a little bit away from the battery, but since they don't have anywhere to go, they repel each other and push back.  An open circuit doesn't produce any current.</p>

	              <p>A capacitor is a special kind of open circuit.  In its simplest form, it's a battery connected to two metal plates that are just barely separated by a small gap (like in the first picture).  The battery's voltage pulls electrons from one plate and pushes it into the other, which causes the electrons to push back.  But the opposite plate has few electrons, so the electrons try to "jump" to the other plate and collect on it.  They can't, but the result is that they collect on the plate and produce a negative charge, while the other plate has few electrons and produces a positive charge.  The region in between has what's called an electric field, and this electric field produces a voltage. The capacitor is called fully charged when that voltage is the same as the voltage of the battery, and at that point, there is no current flow anymore - the system is at equilibrium.</p>

	              <p>One of the most important properties of a capacitor is a property called capacitance.  A capacitor with high capacitance can move a lot of electrons without requiring a big battery.  That property is called capacitance, and a better capacitance comes from both having more surface area for electrons to collect on and a smaller gap between the plates.  The smaller gap allows the electrons on one plate to more easily affect the charges on the other plate.  In a traditional capacitor, like the one shown to the right, that's all a capacitor is - two flat plats, separated by an insulator called a dielectric.</p>

	              <p>Graphene supercapacitors are a special kind of capacitor.  They are a lot like regular capacitors, but on top of their simple metal plate they have a layer of activated carbon - carbon that has holes and pockets to increase surface area (see the picture).  That extra layer of carbon is why supercaps are sometimes called 'double-layer capacitors.' If you flood that activated carbon with an electrolyte, they've got a lot of surface area for electrons to collect on, and so can store a lot more charge than a flat plate.   That means the same voltage might be able to push a thousand times more electrons onto the plate - which means it has a capacitance 1000 times higher, and why it gets to be called a supercapacitor.</p>
	              
	              <p>Regular capacitors are usually measured in millifarads or even nanofarads.  Supercapacitors can have thousands of farads, which means billions of times more charge. </p>
