	              <p>Capacitors are like temporary batteries.  Voltage sources, such as batteries, like to push electrons around.  In a closed circuit, that pushing makes an electrical current that can light up LEDs, move a motor, and so on.

	              If the circuit is open (that is, broken somehwere so it's not a complete loop) the electrons might get pushed a little bit up the wire, but since they don't have anywhere to go, they don't like being squished together and push back.  The open circuit doesn't get any current.

	              A capacitor is a special kind of open circuit.  In its simplest form, it's a battery connected to two metal plates that are separated by a small gap (like in the first picture).  The battery's voltage pulls electrons from one plate and pushes it into the other, which causes the electrons to push back.  But the opposite plate has few electrons, and the electrons building up on the first plate can feel that, so they get pulled as far as they can towards the opposite plate.  After a little while, the the electrons find a steady state - they don't like being near each other, but they are being pushed together by the battery. The result? Electrons collect on one plate, while the other plate is missing a lot of theirs...

	              A capacitor with high capacitance  can move a lot of electrons wihtout requiring a big battery.  That property is called capacitance, and a better capacitance comes from both having more surface area for electrons to collect on and a smaller gap between the plates..  The smaller gap allows the electrons on one plate to more easily affect the charges on the other plate.  In a traditional capacitor, like the one shown to the right, that's all a capacitor is - two flat plats, separated by an insulator called a dielectric.

	              Graphene supercapacitors are a special kind of capacitor.  They are a lot like regular capacitors, but on top of their simple metal plate they have a layer of activated carbon - carbon that has holes and pockets to increase surface area (see the picture).  That extra layer of carbon is why supercaps are sometimes called 'double-layer capacitors.' If you flood that activated carbon with an electrolyte, they've got a lot of surface area for electrons to collect on, and so can store a lot more charge than a flat plate, like the second picture shows.   That means the same voltage might be able to push a thousand times more electrons onto the plate - which means it has a capacitance 1000 times higher, and why it gets to be called a super capacitor.
	              
	              Regular capacitors are usually measured in millifarads or even nanofarads.  Supercapacitors can have thousands of farads, which means billions of times more charge.
