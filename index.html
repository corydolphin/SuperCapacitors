              <h2>Power grid </h2>
              <p>The house, like every other one in the neighborhood, is connected to the grid by a series of power lines. The grid doesn't store energy, so energy is made on-demand at a coal-burning power plant. Energy costs most at peak times, like during the day, and in the summer when air conditioners are on.

              <h2>Portable electronics </h2>
              <p> The handheld electronic of choice is a smartphone. These phones are powered by lithium-ion batteries that take a few hours to charge and need to be charged around once a day.  These batteries don't work well in cold weather, and last only a few years before needing to be replaced.  If it is charged too often or too little, it lasts for even fewer cycles.  But that's not the only energy storage in the handhelds - even today, some digital cameras use capacitors to power the flash, and some even use supercapacitors.</p>

            <h2>Engine</h2>
            <p>A hybrid car has two engines: electric and gas-powered.  Gas engines burn gasoline and use the released heat and pressure to turn pistons. The electric motor is powered by lithium-ion batteries, which are charged by the gasoline engine and also by braking.  The energy from braking is turned to heat in a standard car, so that's all a big gain.
              Hybrids offer improved mileage, but with a big drawback: weight.  Having a full-fledged gasoline engine and a full battery pack is heavy.  Lithium-ion batteries do not last very long, unfortunately, and do not hold nearly as much energy as gasoline for the same weight.</p>

            <h2>Fuel tank</h2>
            <p>Hybrids get their energy from gasoline. Gasoline has a high energy density, around 13 kWh/kg.  That means a gallon gasoline has enough energy to charge an iPhone once a day for almost 20 years. Gasoline is a convenient source of power because it's easy to move - just pump it into your car and it's good to go.
            Gasoline is non-renewable, though, and is a major contributor to increasing global CO2 levels.</p>

              <h2>Solar panels </h2>
              <p>The house is still connected to the grid, but now it makes some of its own power through solar panels.  To reduce peak load, there is a small bank of supercapacitors inside the house.  These supercapacitors can rapidly be charged and discharged, producing very high current efficiently. These supercapacitors are paired with big, high-surge appliances - like air conditioners when they first start, and water heaters. That helps smooth spikes in load generated when large applications such as AC and driers are started, decreasing costs and decreasing strain on the power plant.</p>

              <p>However, capacitors only store DC current, so there is some energy loss converting the energy from AC in the grid to DC in the capacitor and back again.</p>

              <h2>Portable electronics </h2>
              <p> Handheld electronics are getting more power-hungry all the time. The device of the day is a handheld tablet that's really more like a computer than a phone.  Those pesky batteries still take hours to charge, but supercapacitors can help improve the experience.   This tablet has a supercap in it that can charge in just seconds, meaning that a dead battery is never dead for long.  Even if that supercap can only provide a few hour's worth of charge, it takes so little time to charge that it doesn't even matter.</p>

            <h2>Engine</h2>
            <p>Cars now run exclusively on electric motors.  Electric motors are very efficient (easily 80-90%), simple, and reliable.  But they're powerful, too - they can produce a lot of torque, which means jolting acceleration .  However, lithium-ion batteries can't produce quick bursts of power, and pulling maximum current out damages them.  Although supercapacitors still are not energy-dense enough to store power for more than short trips, they can release energy quickly, and so are used in tandem with the batteries to help with acceleration. And they survive hundreds of thousands of charge cycles, so expect just about everything else in the car to break before they do.</p>
