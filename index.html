            <h2>Engine</h2>
            <p>A hybrid car has two engines: electric and gas-powered.  Gas engines burn gasoline and use the released heat and pressure to turn pistons. The electric motor is powered by lithium-ion batteries, which are charged by the gasoline engine and also by braking.  The energy from braking is turned to heat in a standard car, so that's all a big gain.
              Hybrids offer improved mileage, but with a big drawback: weight.  Having a full-fledged gasoline engine and a full battery pack is heavy.  Lithium-ion batteries do not last very long, unfortunately, and do not hold nearly as much energy as gasoline for the same weight.</p>

            <h2>Fueltank</h2>
            <p>Hybrids get their energy from gasoline. Gasoline has a high energy density, around 13 kWh/kg.  That means a gallon gasoline has enough energy to charge an iPhone once a day for almost 20 years. Gasoline is a convenient source of power because it's easy to move - just pump it into your car and it's good to go.
              Gasoline is non-renewable, though, and is a major contributor to increasing global CO2 levels.</p>
